/*
In the worksheet, add two functions, call one add and call the other one subtract.
Each function will take two arguments and each one shall return one value.
Add will return the sum of two numbers and subtract will return the difference of two numbers.
So, save the worksheet and then make sure you test it out by adding some statements that call your new functions.
